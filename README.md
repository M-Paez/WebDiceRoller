# WebDiceRoller

These codes follow Eric Pogue's coding standards. 
The code was based off of the code provided in this video https://youtu.be/PXilNmL9U80?si=Hy8UhThGq0t3mBni as well as ChatGPT for editing it to fit my needs. 
While the code was written based off this YouTube video and with the help of ChatGPT. Each step was taken with the knowledge of how it affected the code. 

This was very difficult. Also made the dice images myself.
This project was completed by Molly Paez.
